+ `<br> <p>Structured and unstructured data differ in many ways, however, the primary difference between the two is that structured data is defined and searchable while unstructured data is contained in its native form. There is vastly more unstructured data in existence, which makes up 80 percent of all enterprise data. This percentage continues to grow, which presents opportunities for forward-thinking businesses to mine data insights.
<br>
The four basic data structure types are linear data structures, tree data structures, hash data structures and graph data structures.
<br>
1. LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
<br>
Linear data structures include arrays, or finite groups of data, with memory locations that allow elements to be accessed through an index key and linked lists. Linked lists order elements within a list so they can be sporadically placed within memory.
<br>2. TREE DATA STRUCTURES
<br>Tree data structures are hierarchical and present a root value with subsets of children that are represented as linked nodes. Tree data structures come in many varieties with several distinct characteristics, including binary trees, binary search trees, red-black trees, weight-balanced trees and binary heaps.
<br>3. HASH TABLES
<br>Hash tables map keys to values, abstracted by additional behaviors through the use of high-level programming languages. Some variations of hash tables include separate chaining and linear probing.
