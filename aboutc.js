+ `<br> <p>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).

Today, the C programming language runs on many different hardware platforms and OSes such as Microsoft and Linux.
<br>
The C language comes with a set of special characteristics, making it one of the most widely used languages of all time. The following are the main benefits of using C:
<br>
Structured. It offers a structured programming approach for breaking down problems into smaller modules or functions that are easy to understand and modify.
<br>Portable. C is machine-independent and C programs can be executed on different machines.
<br>Mid-level programming language. It's a mid-level language that supports the features of both a low-level and a high-level language.
<br>Rich library. It offers numerous built-in library functions that expedite the development process.
<br>Dynamic memory allocation. C supports the dynamic memory allocation feature, which can be used to free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.
<br>Speed. It's a compiler-based language, which makes the compilation and execution of code faster. Since only essential and required features are included in C, it saves processing power and improves speed.
<br>Pointers. C uses pointers, which improve performance by enabling direct interaction with the system memory.
<br>Recursion. C enables developers to backtrack by providing code reusability for every function.
<br>Extensible. A C program can be easily extended. If code is already written, new features and functionalities can be added to it with minor alterations.
<br>C also comes with a few shortfalls, even though it's an ideal language for programming beginners due to its simple syntax, algorithms and modular structure.
